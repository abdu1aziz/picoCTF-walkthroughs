1. This was a fun little flag worth 150points.

2. The Flag gave me a pcap file data.pcap which clearly meant wireshark will be needed.

3. So I popped out my wireshark and started analyzing the packets. I saw alot of HTTP requests.

4. As I saw there were GET requests and also POST request.

5. You guessed it right, I went for POST request and in password field found the flag.
