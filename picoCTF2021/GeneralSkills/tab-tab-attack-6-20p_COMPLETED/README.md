 - I quickly got a zip file.
 - My First assumption after extracting the zip file was to cd into the extracted directory.
 - After `cd'ing` couple of times finally arrived at following path:
 	- [x] `Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku`
 - Now I decided to run my own basic command that I usually run on all binaries.
 - I ran `cat fang-of-haynekhtnamet | grep -a "picoCTF{"`
 - And sure enough I found the flag: `picoCTF{ORIGINAL_FLAG_HIDDEN}>`

> I decided to hide the original flag, so you can go try to find our flag on your own.
