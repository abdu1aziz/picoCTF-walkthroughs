## Web Exploitation - # 1
  

|Code Name|Points |  
|--|--|  
| GET aHEAD | 20p |  
  
 - Simple giveaway in the problem prompt itself was HEAD mentioned in there.
 - The website link was given `http://mercury.picoctf.net:15931/index.php`.
 - Time to fire-up bursuite, I enabled my proxy and confifured it on firefox.
 - Now intercepted the request, and saw if POST request is made color changes to blue, if GET request is made page's color changes to red.
 - Decided to intercept the request and move it down to repeater by click **Send To Repeater** button.
 - Chaged the request parameters from GET to HEAD in the header in burpsuite.
- Finally I got back the Magically flag: `picoCTF{ORIGINAL_FLAG_HIDDEN}`

> I decided to hide the original flag, so you can go try to find our flag on your own.
