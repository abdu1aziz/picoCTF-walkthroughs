 - Simple giveaway in the problem prompt itself was HEAD mentioned in there.
 - The website link was given `http://mercury.picoctf.net:21485/check`.
 - I was on my Google Chrome browser so, before I go to burpsuite and get the big-guns involved. I wanted to try inspect element.
 - I navigated to Application tab in inspect element and then chose **Cookies** in left side navigation pane.
 - There's only 1 cookie called **name** and default value was set to **-1**
 - I started incrementing that value and refreshing the page, as I saw the names values on the page also started changing.
 - Upon reaching close to **20** on my cookie value I found my flag.
 - Finally I got back the Magically flag: `picoCTF{ORIGINAL_FLAG_HIDDEN}`

> I decided to hide the original flag, so you can go try to find our flag on your own.
