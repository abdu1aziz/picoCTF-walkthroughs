 - Simple giveaway in the problem prompt itself was `"There is some interesting information hidden around this site"` mentioned in there.
 - The website link was given `http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/`.
 - I was on my Google Chrome browser so, before I go to burpsuite and get the big-guns involved. I wanted to try CTRL+U to view source code of the webpage.
 - This now disclosed how this static website operates, there are css and js files attached and in the bottom last lines of the webpage.
 - part1 of the flag is disclosed.
 - This ticked me to go check all the attached/linked files on the webpage.
 - Upon checking all the css files, I was able to find only 2 parts of the flag.
 - Now the 3rd part was hidden in the file that stop's google from indexing your website.
 - Ofcourse that was a straight giveaway: `/robots.txt`
 - Another flag was hidden in `"I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?"`
 - Now only thing that came to my mind was to bruteforce directories in the apache server.
 - So I decided to use `dirsearch` _Please Note dirbuster can also be used._
 - I found promising results as shown in screenshot below and I was able to find rest of the parts of the flag.
 - Finally I got back the Magically flag: `picoCTF{ORIGINAL_FLAG_HIDDEN}`

> I decided to hide the original flag, so you can go try to find our flag on your own.
