1. This flag was a logon page. The first thing that came to my mind was how do i bypass it.

2. So I thought of 2 things, SQL injection and maybe cookie manipulation.

3. Firstly I tried SQL Injection and surely enough I logged in to the site successfully but didn't get the flag.

4. Now I went on thinking what could go wrong, started checking in to the cookies for the page and found out:

	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
		admin: False
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5. So Now I changed False to True and refreshed the page which helped me find the flag.


	FLAG FOUND: picoCTF{l0g1ns_ar3nt_r34l_a280e12c}
