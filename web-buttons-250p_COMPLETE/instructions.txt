1. Firstly this seemed like a weird CTF because of its name buttons. But then surely enough, I was able to find out the first button wrapped around a form that makes POST request to button1.php.

2. Now after couple of minutes of analyzing the behavior and source of the pages button1 and button2 I was able to realize that button2 was a hyperlink wrapped in anchor tags. 

3. So I decided what if I make it into a button and send a POST request to the button2.php

4. Surely Enough 10minutes later I had the flag.
